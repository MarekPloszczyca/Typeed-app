"Typeed" is an application that tests user's typing speed with keyboard. It is using React, Typescript and SCSS.
The main focus of creating this application was to consolidate knowledge about core React's features and use it in real application. Desing there goes to the background, because creator do not want to focus on things that he already know.
Although work is in progress and design is going to change in the future.
